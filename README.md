# Airline-Ticket-Price-Prediction-using-Supervised-Learning
Airline Ticket Price Prediction using Supervised Learning
This project focuses on predicting airline ticket prices based on flight duration using supervised machine learning techniques. The aim is to explore the relationship between flight features and fare prices, and visualize insights using Python data visualization libraries.

Project Overview
Objective: Predict the ticket price of a flight using its duration.

Technique Used: Linear Regression (Supervised Learning)

Libraries Used: Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn

Dataset
The dataset contains information about airlines, source & destination cities, duration (in hours), and ticket prices.

Note: The dataset appears to be synthetic and is used for academic purposes only.

Key Features
Data cleaning and preprocessing

Correlation heatmap to explore feature relationships

Data visualization with bar plots and scatter plots

Linear regression model training and prediction

Model accuracy score evaluation

How to Run
Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/divijeswara/airline-ticket-price-prediction.git

Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the Python script: python final_project.py

Visualizations
Heatmap showing correlation between Duration and Ticket Price

Scatter plot and bar chart for comparative analysis

Conclusion
Longer flight durations tend to have higher ticket prices, as shown by a positive correlation. The linear regression model offers a simple yet effective way to predict prices based on flight duration.
